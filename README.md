### 🌱About:
- ✔️Being a non-techie, when I am starting my steps toward learning web development, I feel afraid because it is entirely new for me as I am a tourism graduate shifting my career entirely in a different direction. Still, at the same time, I am also interested to learn about how technology works and have always been fascinated with how using coding, you can create great products and solve various problems.
So I decided it's never too late to start something you like.
For this reason, I started my journey toward learning computer languages, and I am working on it.

- ✔️I'm a fast learner looking for interesting career opportunities in Web as a full-stack developer. 

##### ⚡ One line that describes me best? 
A hard working boy who enjoys good humour & coding.😉😉
