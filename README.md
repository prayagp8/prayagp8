### 🌱About:<br>- ✔️Being a non-techie, when I am starting my steps toward learning web development, I feel afraid because it is entirely new for me as I am a tourism graduate shifting my career entirely in a different direction. Still, at the same time, I am also interested to learn about how technology works and had always been fascinated with how using coding, you can create great products and solve various problems.<br>So I decided it's never too late to start something you like.<br>For this reason, I started my journey toward learning computer languages, and I am working on it.<br><br>- ✔️I'm a fast learner looking for interesting career opportunities in Web as a full-stack developer <img src="https://github.com/TheDudeThatCode/TheDudeThatCode/blob/master/Assets/Handshake.gif" width="29">. <br><br>##### ⚡ One line that describes me best? <br>A hard working boy who enjoys good humour & coding.😉😉
